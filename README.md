# Smart Bottle

A smart device (bottle) that helps the user decide whether the water in the bottle is fit for drinking in real time. The system consists of several electrochemical sensors interfaced to a Raspberry Pi through an Analog to Digitial converter. The designed algorithm collates the sensor data and produces an optimal result based on specified hard-coded strategy. The result is displayed on a 16 X 2 LCD device in a user friendly manner.
